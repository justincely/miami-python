Things that people have asked about but were out of scope for the
bootcamp:

 - ArcGIS specifc libraries
   -  We don't have any experience with this.  I've used PostGIS a
          little ( http://postgis.net/ ) and Postgresql in general has
          excellent Python support
 - C/C++ integration 
   - take a look at the cython project ( http://cython.org/ )
